# libary-app to find book covers my free time coding app 

### for all general proposes this app is considered finish 

- this is more a passion project, I hope to find time to make it better

For amazon goodreads app .. click on my books, and scroll down to tools and click import and export inside the page you will see a Export Library button, this will send you a CSV which can be viewed in google sheets. * honestly you don't need this app to find the photos for the csv but I know some people don't know how to use google sheets*

### to dues
1. put into next JS
2. Fix openlibary to search instead of hardcoding it in javascript
3.  Show all important data not just the cover 
4.  axio/fetch setup and testing API's
5.  prettier for the javascript the code is a bit messy 
6. get rid of tailwind I'm not a fan

### hope to do one day
1. send csv to json and parase out data  { titles, author, etc }
