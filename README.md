# libary-app to find book covers my free time coding app 

- this is more a passion project, I hope to find time to work on it

For amazon goodreads app .. click on my books, and scroll down to tools and click import and export inside the page you will see a Export Library button, this will send you a CSV which can be viewed in google sheets. * honestly you don't need this app to find the photos for the csv but I know some people don't know how to use google sheets*

### to dues
1. Fix openlibary to search instead of hardcoding it in javascript
2.  Show all important data not just the cover 
3.  axios setup and testing API's
4.  prettier for the javascript the code is a bit messy 

### hope to do one day
1. send csv to json and parase out data  { titles, author, etc }
